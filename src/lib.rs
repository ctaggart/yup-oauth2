//! This library can be used to acquire oauth2.0 authentication for services.
//!
//! For your application to use this library, you will have to obtain an application
//! id and secret by
//! [following this guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) (for
//! Google services) respectively the documentation of the API provider you want to connect to.
//!
//! # Device Flow Usage
//! As the `DeviceFlow` involves polling, the `DeviceFlowHelper` should be used
//! as means to adhere to the protocol, and remain resilient to all kinds of errors
//! that can occur on the way.
//!
//! # Service account "flow"
//! When using service account credentials, no user interaction is required. The access token
//! can be obtained automatically using the private key of the client (which you can download
//! from the API provider). See `examples/service_account/` for an example on how to use service
//! account credentials. See
//! [developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount)
//! for a detailed description of the protocol. This crate implements OAuth for Service Accounts
//! based on the Google APIs; it may or may not work with other providers.
//!
//! # Installed Flow Usage
//! The `InstalledFlow` involves showing a URL to the user (or opening it in a browser)
//! and then either prompting the user to enter a displayed code, or make the authorizing
//! website redirect to a web server spun up by this library and running on localhost.
//!
//! In order to use the interactive method, use the `InstalledInteractive` `FlowType`;
//! for the redirect method, use `InstalledRedirect`, with the port number to let the
//! server listen on.
//!
//! You can implement your own `AuthenticatorDelegate` in order to customize the flow;
//! the `InstalledFlow` uses the `present_user_url` method.
//!
//! The returned `Token` is stored permanently in the given token storage in order to
//! authorize future API requests to the same scopes.
//!
//! The following example, which is derived from the (actual and runnable) example in
//! `examples/test-installed/`, shows the basics of using this crate:
//!
//! ```test_harness,no_run
//! use futures::prelude::*;
//! use yup_oauth2::GetToken;
//! use yup_oauth2::{Authenticator, InstalledFlow};
//!
//! use hyper::client::Client;
//! use hyper_rustls::HttpsConnector;
//!
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     // Read application secret from a file. Sometimes it's easier to compile it directly into
//!     // the binary. The clientsecret file contains JSON like `{"installed":{"client_id": ... }}`
//!     let secret = yup_oauth2::read_application_secret(Path::new("clientsecret.json"))
//!         .expect("clientsecret.json");
//!
//!     // Create an authenticator that uses an InstalledFlow to authenticate. The
//!      // authentication tokens are persisted to a file named tokencache.json. The
//!      // authenticator takes care of caching tokens to disk and refreshing tokens once
//!      // they've expired.
//!     let mut auth = Authenticator::new(
//!         InstalledFlow::new(secret, yup_oauth2::InstalledFlowReturnMethod::HTTPRedirect(0))
//!     )
//!     .persist_tokens_to_disk("tokencache.json")
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//!     let s = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file".to_string();
//!     let scopes = vec![s];
//!
//!     // token(<scopes>) is the one important function of this crate; it does everything to
//!     // obtain a token that can be sent e.g. as Bearer token.
//!     match auth.token(scopes).await {
//!         Ok(token) => println!("The token is {:?}", token),
//!         Err(e) => println!("error: {:?}", e),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
